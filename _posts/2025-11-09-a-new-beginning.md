## Getting back on track
Today I'll continue my journey into game development. After a long break, I finally feel ready to dive back in and extend my current project.

Staying motivated and not becoming overwhelmed is key. I'll set small, achievable goals and celebrate each milestone along the way.
Using a Kanban board will help me keep track of tasks and progress. It also lets me focus on one thing at a time.

That way, I'll try to avoid that the project is going into hiatus again. Last time, I got too overwhelmed with the tasks ahead of me. 

Thinking about all the assets like graphics, animations, sound effects, music, and coding made me freeze and do nothing.

This blog is like a personal diary for my game development journey and is another way to stay motivated.

## Reminder to myself
- Mini-Version / prototype of the game first
   - placeholder graphics and sounds
- Focus on one task at a time. Small features like walking, jumping, basic enemy AI to stay motivated.
- No pressure. If I feel overwhelmed, take a break or work on something else for a while.
- It won't be perfect. The goal is to finish the game, not to make it flawless.
- Short sessions are better than doing nothing.
